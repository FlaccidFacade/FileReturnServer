# FileReturnServer
return a file from http request


Create a C/C++ program that will create a server socket program that will return the contents of a file that is requested.  
This program should accept a minimal (any) HTTP request from a web browser (your choice) and return the contents of the 
specified file to be displayed by the web browser client.  It will NOT be multi-threaded.  You must request memory buffers
at the start of the program to be used and not continuously request space from the heap
